// UPT Structure

// utils:
  upti - install package
  uptr - remove package
  uptg - download package
  uptb - build package

  upt - frontend for all of these


# upti - install package
usage: upti <pkgfile>
installs package <pkgfile>

# uptb - build package
usage: uptb
looks for a file named uptbuild.conf.
from this file, reads the following fields:

  name=a name here
  authors=author1,author2,...
  version=a version here, see "version format" below
  license=a license here
  description=a description here
  

// version format:
  versions should be formatted like semantic versioning
  however, the version parser is more loose than that
  so e.g. 2 number fields, 4 number fields are fine
  e.g. 20.4.5.2 is valid, and 10.8 is valid
  0.4-alpha1 and 0.6-beta3 are valid
  2022.06 is valid
  2018.1 is valid

// repo list format:
  file /etc/upt/repos
  all files in /etc/upt/repos.d
  text file
  foreach line:
    repo NAME URL

// package list format:
  in /etc/upt/lists
  text file, named 'reponame'
  foreach line:
    PKGNAME PKGVER SIZE:AUTHORS:DESC:LICENSE

// installed package data format:
  in /etc/upt/db/
  foreach package:
    text file, named 'pkgname'
    first line:
      PKGVER AUTHORS:DESC:LICENSE:REPO
    foreach line:
      OWNED_FILE

packages are simple mtar files (extended to support empty directories, version code 2) structured like this:
  directory 'files/'
    package files as more or less a rootfs overlay, e.g. bin, sbin
  directory 'post/'
    postinstall scripts, run in sorted order
